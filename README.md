# tictactoe
<h2>Overview</h2>
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a 3x3 gameboard where two players take turns marking a cell with their respective symbols ("X" or "O"). The game detects win conditions and ties, displaying the score results for P1 and P2 accordingly.

<h2>Installation</h2>

1. Use `git clone` to clone the repository 

2. Use `cd tictactoe` to navigate to the project directory

3. Open the index.html file in your web browser.

<h2>Development Process</h2>

1. **Initial Setup:** Set up the project with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
2. **Gameboard Object:** Implement the Gameboard object to store and manage the gameboard state.
3. **Player Objects:** Create player objects to represent the players.
4. **Game Flow Control:** Develop an object to control the flow of the game, including turn switching and win/tie detection.
5. **Console Testing:** Test the game logic in the console to ensure it works correctly before integrating with the DOM.
6. **DOM Integration:** Create an object to handle DOM interactions, rendering the gameboard and handling player clicks.
7. **UI Enhancements:** Add features to start/restart the game, display the game results, and display player score.
